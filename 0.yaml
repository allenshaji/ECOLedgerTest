GRETA THUNBERG
Here are some inspirational quotes from Thunberg about climate change, making a difference and standing up to those who harass her:

On impact: "I have learned you are never too small to make a difference."

On intention: "The moment we decide to fulfill something, we can do anything."

On harassment: "When haters go after your looks and differences, it means they have nowhere left to go. And then you know you're winning!"

On change: "Right here, right now is where we draw the line. The world is waking up. And change is coming whether you like it or not."

On not giving up: “You must take action. You must do the impossible. Because giving up is never an option.”

On purpose: “I’m not that special. I can’t convince everyone. I’m just going to do what I want to do and what will have the most impact.”

On changing the rules: "We can’t save the world by playing by the rules, because the rules have to be changed. Everything needs to change – and it has to start today."

On unity: "Together and united, we are unstoppable."

On telling the truth: "I often talk to people who say, ‘No, we have to be hopeful and to inspire each other, and we can’t tell [people] too many negative things’ . . . But, no — we have to tell it like it is. Because if there are no positive things to tell, then what should we do, should we spread false hope? We can’t do that, we have to tell the truth."

On urgency: "My message is that we'll be watching you. This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean. Yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you. You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words. Yet I am one of the lucky ones. People are suffering."

It seems to me that the natural world is the greatest source of excitement; the greatest source of visual beauty; the greatest source of intellectual interest. It is the greatest source of so much in life that makes life worth living.

What humans do over the next 50 years will determine the fate of all life on the planet.

Instead of controlling the environment for the benefit of the population, perhaps we should control the population to ensure the survival of our environment.

No one will protect what they don’t care about, and no one will care about what they have never experienced.

The truth is: the natural world is changing. And we are totally dependent on that world. It provides our food, water and air. It is the most precious thing we have and we need to defend it.

How could I look my grandchildren in the eye and say I knew what was happening to the world and did nothing.

The World is full of wonders, but they become more Wonderful, not less Wonderful when Science looks at them.

Bringing nature into the classroom can kindle a fascination and passion for the diversity of life on earth and can motivate a sense of responsibility to safeguard it.

Anyone who believes in indefinite growth on a physically finite planet is either mad or an economist.

We can now destroy or we can cherish-the choice is ours.
